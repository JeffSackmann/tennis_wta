## WTA Tennis Rankings, Results, and Stats

For now, this contains my master WTA player file, plus historical rankings.

The player file columns are: player_id, first_name, last_name, hand, birth_date, country_code.

The columns for the ranking files are: ranking_date, ranking, player_id, ranking_points, tours. 'Tours' is WTA jargon for certain types of tournaments played, and that column is not anywhere near complete.

Rankings are through the end of 2014.

Update, 21/3/15

My WTA match result database is now here, as well. These files (e.g. 'wta_matches_2014.csv') contain all tour-level singles matches for that season. To make them easier to use, I've included a fair bit of redundancy with the biographical and ranking files: each row contains several columns of biographical information, along with ranking and ranking points, for both players. Ranking data, as well as age, are as of tourney_date, which is almost always the Monday at or near the beginning of the event.
